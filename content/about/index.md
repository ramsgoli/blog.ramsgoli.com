I've spent the past 22 years of my life as a persistent learner and shameless optimist.
I'm known for always asking questions, challening my assumptions, and firmly maintaining an "anything is possible" attitude.

This past March of 2020, I graduated from UCLA with a B.S. in computer science.
Prior to graduating, I've been a part of a variety of organizations, including [Gorgias](https://gorgias.io/), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/home),
and [Uber Technologies](https://www.uber.com/) as a software engineer intern, [UCLA DevX](https://ucladevx.com) as both a Product Manager and President,
and [USAC Facilities Commission](https://www.facebook.com/USAC.Facilities/) as a Committee Director.

These days, you can find me living with my lovely parents in Petaluma, where I work
for [Heap](https://heap.io) building next-gen product analytics tools and frequently [run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/48965974).
I'm passionate about empowering people to succeed in their daily lives.

> The Time Is Now

Yes, that was my senior quote. I know, it's somewhat tame, but I believe that time is an invaluable resource, and I despise wasting it. You should too!
