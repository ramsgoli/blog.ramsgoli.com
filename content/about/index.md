I've spent the past 21 years of my life as a persistent learner and shameless optimist.
I'm known for always asking questions, challening my assumptions, and firmly maintaining an "anything is possible" attitude.

My mission to engage in continuous learning has taken me to the sprawling beaches of Southern California, where I attend UCLA as a senior pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.
I've worked at a variety of organizations along the way, including [Gorgias](https://gorgias.io/), [PayPal, Inc](https://www.paypal.com/us/home),
and [Uber Technologies, Inc.](https://www.uber.com/) as a software engineer intern, and at [UCLA DevX](https://ucladevx.com) as both a Product Manager and President.
I'm passionate about building software that empowers people to succeed in their daily lives.
I bring a holistic approach to the engineering process. My work is always guided by extensive research and a thorough understanding of the needs of stakeholders.

> The Time Is Now

Yes, that was my senior quote. I know, it's somewhat tame, but I truly believe that time is an invaluable resource, and I despise wasting it.
I try to spend my time doing as many _different_ things as possible - I've played the piano, trumpet, and guitar for
several years, and I also compete on [UCLA's Men's Ultimate Frisbee Team](https://www.facebook.com/UclaSmaugUltimate/) during the academic year.
I'm also a budding foodie, and I write alot on [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-suvTLALBAzOhXwLNpJjzw)!
