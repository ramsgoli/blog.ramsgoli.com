One of most beautiful things in the entire world is laughter. It doesn't matter
if you are black or white, male or female identifying, young or old. If you are faced with
a moment in life that you find amusing, you let out a giggle, or a rowdy guffaw. Of course, the quirks of life that we find humorous differ person to person. Our perception of
what is "funny" is shaped by a myriad of past experiences - of trauma, joy, excitement, fear.
The often childish or esoteric jokes I crack around the coffee table don't always stick with my friends,
and the humor they engage in often goes over my head.\
\
Yet, wherever you come from, you too possess a deeply _human_ ability to explore social boundaries through laughter.
Just like every other person, your chest and throat work in concert to belt out a wide-toothed, smile-so-hard-your-cheeks-hurt, hearty laugh,
the moment a thought tickles your mind. Laughter is a human universal. We all do it, and we should try a little harder to make
others do it as well. Sharing a laugh with someone lowers the emotional walls that stand in between the two of you,
and allows you to, over time, cultivate a real friendship in their place.\
\
Relationships are built upon the act of sharing one's own belongings with others - time, empathy, love.
I recently caught up with a friend late into the night, sharing vulnerable stories in their full embarassment and discomfort. Several hours later,
after thoroughly probing the depths of each other's inhibitions, we stopped and looked at each other.\
\
We had laid everything on the table. We had nothing left to say.\
So, we just laughed.


> Laugh, and the whole world laughs with you.
