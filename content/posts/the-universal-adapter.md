The _Universal Adapter_, in my own words, possesses the unique trait of hyper-compatibility.
Anyone can approach the _Univeral Adapter_, plug into them, and instantly be exposed to a source
of warmth and friendship. A _Universal Adapter_ is an idealized social construct - a human being capable of befriending _anyone_.\
\
Does the Universal Adapter exist?

And if so, how is it possible? How can someone truly be friends with anyone?\
\
I've recently stumbled across the key to universal compatibility, thanks to the prior work of my new friend AB.
The secret is time. The longer you spend in someone's presence, the more refined your ability is to see what makes them laugh,
what exasperates them, what draws their ire and what makes them feel light and dreamy. I can be friends with
anyone, so long as I put conscious effort in spending more time with them. That means inviting them to spend
their lunch with you, or asking them about their next spot to visit on a Taco Tuesay (and maybe even
butting your way into their plans). No matter your assumptions of a person's pre-existing reservations
or judgements, you can find a form-fitting spot for yourself in their life - if you just be present.
You are a univeral adapter.

_Why am I writing this? Not too long ago, I used to believe that there were innate qualities about me that 
would bar myself from befriending certain types of people. Some peole are just too cool for me,
and would be uninterested in associating with me. It was an assumption that perhaps stemmed
from my recent lack of self-esteem. It is more or less bullshit now. Everyday, I observe firsthand
the power that simply being present in someone's life can have. If I cast aside whatever
inhibitions I have regarding someone, and allow myself to spend time with them, I can befriend
anyone. I'm writing this to remind myself
that I don't have to discredit my ability to be a universal adapter._
