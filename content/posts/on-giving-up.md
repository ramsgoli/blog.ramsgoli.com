So many articles out there preach "proven methods to never give up." We live in such a fast-paced
society where execution and forward progress is worshipped. Quitting on a challenge, task, or idea can
make us feel weak, and is often frowned upon. It feels like we aren't strong enough to finish what we set out to accomplish,
or like we don't have the mental resolve to persevere. Giving up practicing the trumpet after
starting college always nagged at the back of my mind like a lonely child who tugs
at the bottom of his father's coat, innocently pleading for more attention. I had never been the best musician
in band all throughout high school, and packing away my brass tool always felt like an admission
to myself that I would never really be any good.\

We shouldn't forget the power of giving up. What if you gave up on something because you
knew all along that something more significant lay ahead of you? If you re-prioritized, you could
set yourself up for an even better opportunity. It's impossible to know what exactly you
are getting yourself into when you take your first steps. NGL, I've thought about giving up on this blogging idea
once or twice. When that happens, I remind myself to pick my battles more carefully.
Where is the excess in my life that I can shave off? What other mental weights can I drop to
give myself more headspace? I'm more informed now than I ever was. I trust myself to make the right
decision, but I also trust myself to know when I've made the wrong one.\

There's nothing wrong with giving up when you have to. Sometimes you have to give up
in order to start again.
