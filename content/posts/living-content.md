I just came back from a camping trip with friends with several fresh thoughts
ready to brew.\
\
I've always loved being entrenched in the wilderness, ever since I went on my
first mountain biking trip through the careening hill of Mt. Tam during the sixth
grade. I even wrote my UC college essay on that experience, and it somehow landed
me a spot in UCLA. Crazy.

Anyways, being lost in the trees has always been the state of being that I gravitate to
most. I've always thought about one day moving myself out somewhere near the wilderness.
I could work a simple job, live on a large plot of land, raise my own sheep and chicken.
I would probably be really happy too. It doesn't take much to make a human happy. We only
require so much basic sustenance.\
\
Would I be really satisfied though? I know what I am capable of, and the thought of throwing
away that potential is daunting. I could work as a successful software engineer
in a big city, or start my own company and build something amazing on my own.
How much am I willing to sacrifice?
