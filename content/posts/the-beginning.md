I've been meaning to create this blog for a long time now. The biggest two reasons that have been
eating at my brain for a while now are as follows

* Life has gotten super hectic lately, and I feel that if I don't slow down to recollect
my thoughts/memories every once in a while, they will vanish. I'm a big believer in memories,
and experiences. I really value the past, and my goal is that, here, I'll be able to hold
onto some of it.
* I feel that I still haven't found my real voice. I sometimes find that I
act different around my different groups of friends, and I can't quite figure out why. Maybe it's beacuse
I care too much about what people think of me, and I have this idea that _other_ people have an ideal
version of me, and I need to live up to that ideal. But I'm not too big of a fan of that. Maybe here,
I'll start to whittle away at the one voice that I really like, my voice.

I used to read _a lot_ of tech blog articles. And I still do. But lately, I've been straying away from
that weathered trail. It's been awesome. I've been debating with my friends about
really intriguing/mind-bending topics. I've been trying to open up to my friends more. I go on Medium
and read stories written by mothers who deal with the stress of post-labor. There's a lot of life out there.
So much to experience!

I'm going to try and write frequently. Maybe once a week? Ideally everyday, but I'm not really an idealist.
I'm just going to try my best.\

Cheers
