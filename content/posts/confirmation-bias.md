We largely tune into the same news channels, follow the same twitter feeds, subscribe to the same youtube channels
that feed into our already fine-tuned perception of the outside world, of the "other side." We hang out with
those who espouse the same beliefs we do, and are quick to dismiss the opinions coming from the opposite end of the
spectrum.\
\
No individual is at fault for demonstrating such commonplace behavior.
Our bodies are always fighting to remain in harmony, and words from politicians that we perceive as vile or unethical
introduce unwanted entropy into our minds.

This is _confirmation bias_ at work. It's not difficult to succumb to it either. If we see someone on Twitter or Facebook
who shares the same views as us, we hit the follow button or send them a friend request. Soon, our feeds are populated
with more of the same ideas that we already held to be true. If we encounter someone in these social media networks
who says things that make us uncomfortable, we block or mute them, throwing those mutinous crew members off the ship and
continuing to sail onwards along the same route.\
I've encountered this firsthand - my own friends will refuse to engage in conversation over dissenting views, even when
I acknowledge that I share the same ones they do. I've been called _thick-skinned_, _frustrating_, _impossible_ all for
surfacing ideas that I don't even believe in, but believe important to talk about.\

Confirmation bias is a dangerous trap that we all, myself included, often fall prey to. I mean, _know thine enemy_,
or something like that, right? How are we supposed to defeat the enemy if we can't even listen to them, empathize with
their arguments, and then construct the right points to take them down? Sometimes, (who knows), they may know something
that we don't.
