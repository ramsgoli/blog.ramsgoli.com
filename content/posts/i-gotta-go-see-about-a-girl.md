Will Hunting has been gifted a prodigious brain. His mind is unlike anyone else's before him.
Yet instead of exercising his mental faculties to solve the next great mathematical challenges,
he sets off for California in pursuit of the girl of his dreams.\
\
Will Hunting is a foolish man, right? Why would he throw away an opportunity of a lifetime,
all for one girl?\
\
Well, what is more important for the soul - doing what one _should_ do, or what one _wants_ to do?
It's a question that has certainly weighed on everyone's mind at some point in time. Do I fill out
one more job application, or just flip on the tv instead? Do I go out for a run right when my alarm
kicks me out of bed at 7 am, or do I hit the snooze button and fall right into my sheets?
Each moment of the day is filled with these sorts of micro decisions. Am I doing the right thing right now?
Do I want to be doing this?\
\
How do you come up with the answers to these questions?
***
Simple. Do what you want to do. All the time. If you don't want to be doing what you think
you should be doing, maybe you're just not cut out for doing that thing. Maybe you need
to reconsider what you believe is important to you. Don't spend what little time you have
doing things that only _seem_ essential. If you constantly
do what you truly want to do, you might just end each day a little more satisfied with yourself. And with
what short lives we live anyhow, isn't that what really matters?
