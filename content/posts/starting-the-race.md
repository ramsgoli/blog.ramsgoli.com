Not everyone gets to begin the race at the starting line. Some of us start way
in the back, struggling to play catch up for miles on end. I was born to two
working parents, who lived out their own American Dream to move to this country 
and provide for their kids. I grew up in a nice town with enough money in the family
bank account to carry me through a University education. For all intents and purposes,
I was that kid who snuck off the blocks before the starting pistol went off. I'm a lucky
guy with a head start. And as I'm running this grueling race, I ought to look around more
and give a hand where I can.
