{{< figure src="/img/debate/trapped.jpeg" >}}

I spend way too much time in my own head.\
\
I am often the moderator of a debate between two
bitter enemies clashing head to head, which takes place after nearly 
every social interaction I have with people. Voice #1 in my head will say "Ram, you should've
said _this_ just a minute ago," while Voice #2 will immediately interject with a "No Ram, you
should've said _that_ instead." I'll replay the interaction in my head over and over,
imagining every possible way the conversation could have been steered towards something more
interesting or productive.\
\
I know this can't be a healthy habit. Soon enough, I'm going to start having these internal
debates mid-conversation with people, and I will freeze. I will be unable to pick which voice in my head I want
to give the microphone too. Funny enough however, the more time I spend writing these blog
posts, the more time I spend locked in my own head, replaying how exactly each sentence sounds,
debating whether to keep it or reword. Blogging is both unleashing my voice for
the world to hear, and trapping me with my own unrestrained thoughts. Ah, the cruel
irony.
