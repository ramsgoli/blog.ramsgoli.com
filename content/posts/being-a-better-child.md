I suspect that I haven't been a very good child as of late. I often forget to text my mother back.
I don't spend as much time with my parents when I'm back home as I should. I find myself subconsciously
avoiding conversation with them, rather than investing in it. These facts have led me to come up with a list
of demands for myself/habits to form. Here goes.

* I will text my mother once every day
* I will call my parents (at least) every other day
* Before going back to school, I will spend (at least) one entire day solely in their company
* I will verbally tell them how important they are to me and my success

It's time to stop feeling guilty for being a distant son.
