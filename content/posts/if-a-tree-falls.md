Every time I went out with friends, I would take a picture for my story. I needed to scroll through
my feed, checking what everyone else was up to, how many people had seen my story.\

> If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?

As philosopher George Berkeley said in his work _A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge_,
"The objects of sense exist only when they are perceived." I had come to believe that I wasn't having
enjoying myself unless someone else saw that I was doing so. If I don't take a photo for the gram, am 
I really _having fun_?

***

Hell yeah I am. I like to think I'm having more fun with my life right now than anyone else I know.
I don't need views on an ephermal story to tell me so. Out with Instagram and Snapchat, the endless
onslaught of contrived smiles and sounds. Only I need to be privy to my own feelings of content.
