Today's writing is a rather short one - sort of emblematic of the topic of the piece.\
It's 1:55 am. I've been meaning to write this piece all day, but I've only just gotten 
home and found some time for myself. I also need to get to sleep.\
\
Telling yourself that you have more time is one of the biggest lies you will ever tell yourself.
More often than not, you don't.
You put off signing up for next quarter's classes till the evening, pretend like you didn't
see your friend's text so you can instead focus on your tv show.
Soon enough, that time you had allocated to tend to your backlog is interrupted by
some other responsibility. Or, worse, that time you had accounted for and depended on stood you up. It had
better plans, and you were foolish to think it would cater to you.\
\
You are convinced that you will tackle your responsibilites at a later time, but that time
is just a myth. There are only 86400 seconds in a day - solve your problems _now_.
