_Disclaimer: today's thoughts stem from the wise words
of my good friend Karen._

I often get intimated when asking my colleagues to review my work. I work on a team
of several senior engineers who all possess extensive experience working
in the industry. I often think about how I sound to them, or if my work will be recognized
by them as good quality. This leads me to often spend too much time
securing the approval of my team members on small tasks before moving forward.

> Hey Jack, can you take a look at my code? Do you think I did this the right way?

Instead of being able to move quickly through my tasks, I am blocked on a thumbs-up 
from someone who may not even have full context on the thing I'm working on.\
\
What if, instead of putting the ball in someone else's court, I keep it in my own?
I'm starting to tell my teammates "This is what I've done. If you see anything that could
be done better, please let me know. Otherwise, I'm moving forward with this." This simple
declaration shifts the power dynamic back in my favor, and enables me to move quickly. _I am
the owner. This is my work._\
\
Taking ownership is definitely not easy, but it results in a brand new attitude towards
your daily routines and responsibilities. Rather than feeling like a passenger on a fast
moving train, I feel as if I am the conductor, able to control the pace as I see fit.
