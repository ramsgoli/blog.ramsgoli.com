Finding motivation to accomplish something can be a difficult challenge, especially
when you need to also motivate those around you. Talking about how difficult
the job can be if not everyone is doing their part can dampen spirits, and relying on
enthusiasm and excitement in your speech is not always sustainable.\
\
I think the best way to bring out motivation in others is create alignment.
If you start with a high
level mission, a "We're going to Mars" type moonshot, its easy to break it down 
into several sub-objectives in support of that high level mission, and continue
to break them down into actionable accomplishments. People will usually latch onto this chain of missions somewhere
along the line and find one they resonate with. When everyone is latched on, and can see how 
their efforts will work their way up the chain in service of the objective, motivation runs high.\
\
I've been thinking about this strategy in the context of running a company or a campus club,
but I'd like to figure out how I can use this technique to motivate myself everyday. How
do I get myself to go on that run, or prep for that interview coming up, or speak to that peron I see often
but feel timid around. What is that thing that I need to align myself towards? Do I care
about doing the most good for the world? Do I prioritize making enough money to support myself
and my future family? Can I somehow align both of these into a higher mission? How the hell
do I know when I've found the right alignment chain, and how much time do I even have ??
