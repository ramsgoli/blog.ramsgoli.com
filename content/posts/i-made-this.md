{{< figure src="/img/imadethis/avocado.jpg" >}}

This morning, I made myself an avocado toast at work. I mashed up an entire avocado,
sliced up the packaged hard boiled egg, toasted the bread, assembled each topping delicately,
and even applied a medley of salt and pepper on top. After a challenging, five minutes 
of work, I sat down at the kitchen table with my creation and admired what I had put together.
It was truly a masterpiece. And I had made it _myself_.
***
I rarely think about all the effort that takes place for that avocado toast to appear on my
plate in the morning. I forget that before I grab the avocado off of the shelf, a farmer
has to actually plant the seeds of the avocado trees. The avocados have to be plucked, sorted,
screened for appearance, then stickered, packaged, and shipped to the supermarket. Each
of these steps requires hundreds of workers, especially at the scale that these fruits are produced at.
And, I don't even know how the bread is made. But I can only imagine...\
\
When I make my avocado toast in the morning, I am literally standing on the shoulders of giants.
Every one of those steps I mentioned earlier must go right for the next to take place. Hundreds
of people have to be working together in harmony for me to enjoy my assemblage of green paste and
bread.\
\
I struggle to come up with an episode in my life that is not product of a million other events accurately 
filing down an assembly line. I felt a sense of success when I bit into that toast
this morning, but success is expensive, and I don't always realize how much of a deal I am getting. Maybe I won't complain about the price
of an avocado toast the next time I'm at brunch?
