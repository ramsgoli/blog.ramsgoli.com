Today marks day one of my [month-long quest](/posts/thirty-footsteps/) to paint my thoughts into words. _Publicly_.
Truth is, I've been writing to myself all year. I created a [bullet journal](https://bulletjournal.com/)
for myself at the start of 2019. I had never kept a journal before, never wrote down my thoughts, never sat down
to question the ebbing of emotions and ideas that coursed through my mind. For most of my life, I had treated my
subconscious as a tomb which could not be disturbed. Reflecting on my emotions was difficult. I was both incapable and
unwilling to keep trying.\

For those who don't know what Bullet Journaling is - it's a method of journaling that lets you keep track of the past,
present, and future in a style that best suits you. It's highly customizable, and is the perfect brain-dump, task tracker,
and reflective medium. To a person like me who had never journaled before, it was like picking up a guitar for the
first time. You give it a few strums to no avail, but you're immediately hooked and captivated by the thought of 
producing beautiful rhythms. So, you keep strumming and keep strumming, slowly sounding more melodic each day. That's what
happened to me. I was getting better, and I loved it.

The building block of a Bullet Journal is the _spread_, a set of two open-face pages. Some examples of spreads are
daily logs, monthly logs, habit trackers, to-do list, [etc](https://www.bulletjournaladdict.com/spreads/14-bullet-journal-ideas/).
My favorite spread to date is my _Monthly Log._ Everyday, I jot down one significant thing that occured during the day. It gives me
a chance to reconcile the often hectic parts of the day into one memory that stands out, worthy of being remembered.

Looking back at previous month's logs, I can retell a story in my mind.
I piece together each day's happenings into one big, beautiful narrative.
It's like pulling out the guitar one night and recalling that song you once struggled to learn for weeks. The chords wake
from their slumber to flow through your mind and become palpable again, vibrating through your fingers and into thin air.\

Bullet journaling has taught me to find something great out of every day. It's allowed me to reinvest in writing,
a skill I had left dormant for too long. I think a bit harder now, and reflect more often than I ever had. I believe BuJo'ing has changed my life.
