Free will doesn't exist. The idea that humans have control over their thoughts, and thus over their actions,
can not be true. We are an amalgamation of chemical and biological processes, which obey the laws of physics, rather
than our own will. Given any set of inputs, our brains will always act in the same manner, every time. It's like plugging
in values into some convoluted quadratic formula. If you give the equation the same inputs, it will always
output the same value. Who is to say our brains act any differently? And if this really is the case, if our brains are truly
deterministic, we have no control over them.\
\
Moral of the story: don't get too worked up over life. It's happening the way it's meant to be, and there is no other
way.
