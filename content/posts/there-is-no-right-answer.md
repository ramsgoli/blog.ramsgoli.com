The questions that bother me the most are the ones that I can never come up with an answer to.
They leave behind a queasy aftertaste that I just can't get rid of. I love being proven wrong
in an argument, because the defeat will add something new to my repertoire of reasoning.
But when we reach a stalemate, it feels queasy, and unsatisfactory. We made it so far, right to the edge of the cliff
overlooking the eager blue waters below, but we won't make the jump.\

Here is a question for you to ponder: is PDA (public display of affection) a good or bad thing? I myself am against PDA. I always
felt that it creates exclusion between a group of people or friends all hanging out together, separating
two people from the rest. I would much rather have everyone hang out as one unit. I tried arguing
this point with a friend, who firmly held her ground in support of the opposite answer. PDA can
reaffirm the comfort and fondness you have with your partner. If you are surrounded by your
friends, they are probably used to the affection between the two of you, and so the PDA you share
is not disconcerting anyways.\

The stubborn ego inside of me wanted to continue arguing its point. It wasn't comfortable
giving up on a seemingly winnable argument, but it couldn't articulate anything stronger than
what it was facing from the other side. In the end, the two of us simply came to the same conclusion.

> There is no right answer.

Moreover, everyone has their own assessment of what is _right_ or _wrong_.
It's not always my responsibility to change someone's else mind to mirror mine, but it
is my responsibility to at least think about why their answer doesn't align with mine.
The human condition isn't dictated by universal laws; you can try your best to come up with
an explanation for every quandry you face, but often you will be met with an impenetrable conclusion.

Sorry, _Ego_. You're allowed to have an opinion, but it won't always be right. Sometimes, it'll be
flat out wrong. And sometimes, there just is no right answer. We'll be cool with that.
