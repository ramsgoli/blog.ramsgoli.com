		<h1>Hey there! Ram Goli here. ðŸ‘‹</h1>
		<div class="content">
			<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the past 21 years of my life as a persistent learner and shameless optimist.
I&rsquo;m known for always asking questions, challening my assumptions, and firmly maintaining an &ldquo;anything is possible&rdquo; attitude.</p>

<p>My mission to engage in continuous learning has taken me to the sprawling beaches of Southern California, where I attend UCLA as a senior pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.
I&rsquo;ve worked at a variety of organizations along the way, including <a href="https://gorgias.io/">Gorgias</a>, <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/home">PayPal, Inc</a>,
and <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber Technologies, Inc.</a> as a software engineer intern, and at <a href="https://ucladevx.com">UCLA DevX</a> as both a Product Manager and President.
I&rsquo;m passionate about building software that empowers people to succeed in their daily lives.
I bring a holistic approach to the engineering process. My work is always guided by extensive research and a thorough understanding of the needs of stakeholders.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Time Is Now</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that was my senior quote. I know, it&rsquo;s somewhat tame, but I truly believe that time is an invaluable resource, and I despise wasting it.
I try to spend my time doing as many <em>different</em> things as possible - I&rsquo;ve played the piano, trumpet, and guitar for
several years, and I also compete on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UclaSmaugUltimate/">UCLA&rsquo;s Men&rsquo;s Ultimate Frisbee Team</a> during the academic year.
I&rsquo;m also a budding foodie, and I write alot on <a href="https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-suvTLALBAzOhXwLNpJjzw">Yelp</a>!</p>
