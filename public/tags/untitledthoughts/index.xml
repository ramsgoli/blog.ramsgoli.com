      <description>Free will doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist. The idea that humans have control over their thoughts, and thus over their actions, can not be true. We are an amalgamation of chemical and biological processes, which obey the laws of physics, rather than our own will. Given any set of inputs, our brains will always act in the same manner, every time. It&amp;rsquo;s like plugging in values into some convoluted quadratic formula. If you give the equation the same inputs, it will always output the same value.</description>
