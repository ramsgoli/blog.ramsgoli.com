      <description>Today marks day one of my month-long quest to paint my thoughts into words. Publicly. Truth is, I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing to myself all year. I created a bullet journal for myself at the start of 2019. I had never kept a journal before, never wrote down my thoughts, never sat down to question the ebbing of emotions and ideas that coursed through my mind. For most of my life, I had treated my subconscious as a tomb which could not be disturbed.</description>
