      <description>This morning, I made myself an avocado toast at work. I mashed up an entire avocado, sliced up the packaged hard boiled egg, toasted the bread, assembled each topping delicately, and even applied a medley of salt and pepper on top. After a challenging, five minutes of work, I sat down at the kitchen table with my creation and admired what I had put together. It was truly a masterpiece.</description>
