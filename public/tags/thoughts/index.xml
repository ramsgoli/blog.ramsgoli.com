      <description>The feeling of discomfort when your beliefs run counter to your behaviors.
 It&amp;rsquo;s that itch that you can&amp;rsquo;t seem to scratch deep within the back of your mind. What do you do to get rid of it? You only have two options right? You either change your beliefs, or you change your behaviors.
But what if you can&amp;rsquo;t just change either? You&amp;rsquo;ve become too comfortable with your behavior to justify doing anything else, and you&amp;rsquo;re too stubborn to let go of your beliefs so easily.</description>
