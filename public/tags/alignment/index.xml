      <description>Finding motivation to accomplish something can be a difficult challenge, especially when you need to also motivate those around you. Talking about how difficult the job can be if not everyone is doing their part can dampen spirits, and relying on enthusiasm and excitement in your speech is not always sustainable.
I think the best way to bring out motivation in others is create alignment. If you start with a high level mission, a &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re going to Mars&amp;rdquo; type moonshot, its easy to break it down into several sub-objectives in support of that high level mission, and continue to break them down into actionable accomplishments.</description>
