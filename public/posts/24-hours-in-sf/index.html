<p>This weekend, I had the pleasure of hosting my good friend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100013556977844&amp;hc_ref=ARTCibTsupEQodn4C6prs6WeRj8GaLwOEr693rnYlgNoNpAQu1fu80DNn25LQKkt8rk&amp;__tn__=lC-R">Eric Siegel</a> in the Bay Area. I wanted to show him around San Francisco - my favorite sights from the times I visited, the must-see tourist attractions, the classic SF experience. Eric was only in town for two nights, and I had to make sure that the little time he had here was lacking of a dull moment. So on Saturday morning at 10 am, we each packed a change of clothes, and set out to see what we could experience in 24 hours. Here&rsquo;s all that we accomplished.</p>

<h2 id="the-dropoff">The Dropoff</h2>

<p>After doing some hasty research prior to our departure, I had come to the conclusion that the <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/garages-lots/north-beach-garage">North Beach Parking Garage</a> would be the safest place to park a car overnight. For a full 24 hours, we would have to pay only $36. At exactly 12 pm on Saturday, we arrive at the parking garage, collect our belongings, and say farewell to the car.</p>

<h2 id="the-cable-cars">The Cable Cars</h2>

<p>Our first destination is the Powell/Mason Cable Car turnaround, to ride the leisurely SF cable cars. We board the car just a few minutes before it is ready to depart. Eric pulls his camera out of his bag.
<img class="snap-image" src="/img/24-hours/cable.jpeg" /><br />
And we&rsquo;re ready to go! Along the way, we see some sweet views of the Bay Bridge creeping in between tall buildings. We wave at European tourists, who generally wave back.</p>

<h2 id="the-gardens">The Gardens</h2>

<p>The cable car lets off at Union Square, and we&rsquo;re thrown into a swarm of shoppers lugging around large bags filled to the brim from stores who&rsquo;s names I can not pronounce. At this point, it&rsquo;s around 1 PM, and we&rsquo;re both very hungry. We throw some searches into Yelp, and come across a salad place called Mixt (think Chipotle for even healthier people). We pick up some food to go, walk across the street to the Yerba Buena gardens, and sit down on the grass with our meals.
<img class="snap-image" src="/img/24-hours/lunch.jpeg" /><br />
There is an Asian music festival taking place in the Gardens at the same time, so we chew on our dressed leaves and veggies while listening to an orchestra of child musicians.</p>

<h2 id="the-lew">The Lew</h2>

<p>After lunch, we head to the <a href="https://www.thecjm.org/">Contemporay Jewish Museum</a>. Eric is Jewish, and I love museums. Naturally, we had to visit.<br />
The main attraction is a new exhibit titled <a href="https://www.thecjm.org/exhibitions/103">Lew the Jew and his Circle</a>. It details the life of a Jewish-American tattoo artist living in NYC in the early 1900s. Albert Morton Kurzman, or &ldquo;Lew the Jew,&rdquo; fought in the Spanish-American War, and learned the art of tattooing in the Phillipines. He brought the art back to states, so that kids like Eric and I could now stand and wonder how pissed our parents would be if we came back home with tattoos.</p>

<h2 id="the-climb">The Climb</h2>

<p>After exiting the museum feeling more rebellious than usual, we decide to take up the suggestion of our good friend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bryson.levisay?fb_dtsg_ag=Adwws3Kyd9Y28sMB1vO9BKq3QYKuFTupJP4Z3Q0d_5kmCg%3AAdy-ClFfN2BHsq7NW6fkF1_JX52YjXce2CX_6cSaE1hDRA">Bryson Levisay</a> and walk from the Embarcadero, up the Filbert Steps, to Coit Tower. I silently beg my sweat glands to stay closed as we climb up the 31.5% grade vertical.<br />
Upon reaching the top of the staircase, we wait in line to pay for our ticket, and then wait in line again to take the elevator to the top. The view is pristine. The wild breeze wipes the beads of sweat right off of my skin.

<h2 id="the-meal">The Meal</h2>

<p>It is now approaching 6 pm, and we are yet again craving another meal. This time, in the heart of Little Italy, we sit down in a small Asian restaurant. A lady walks in demanding to use the restroom. The server, who speaks little English, asks that she leave. The lady cusses out everyone everyone in the restaurant and angrily storms out. Our friend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/paul.ramstad.5?fb_dtsg_ag=Adwws3Kyd9Y28sMB1vO9BKq3QYKuFTupJP4Z3Q0d_5kmCg%3AAdy-ClFfN2BHsq7NW6fkF1_JX52YjXce2CX_6cSaE1hDRA">Paul Ramstad</a>, who has graciously offered to house us for the night, walks in to meet us. We quickly pay the tab and leave.</p>

<h2 id="the-show">The Show</h2>

<p>Earlier in the day, I bought tickets to see <a href="http://stevetrevino.com/">Steve Trefino</a> perform at <a href="http://www.cobbscomedy.com/">Cobb&rsquo;s Comedy Club</a>. We head to the club and are seated near the back of a packed but intimate feeling room. At 7:30 pm sharp, the MC comes out to get us warmed up. He is gay and Latino, and isn&rsquo;t afraid to piss off some heads in the room with his hilarious insights into his vision of minotiry communities.<br />
The headliner, Steve, sufficiently leaves us in tears by the end of the night. At one point, I am keeled over at the hip, ferociously belting out laughter, hoping that he takes a pause for me to catch my breath. It was devastatingly hilarious.</p>

<h2 id="the-scoop">The Scoop</h2>

<p>After the show ends, Eric, Paul, and I take to North Beach in search of something to satisfy our sweet tooth.
We stumble into a gelato store, order ourselves a few scoops, and share our favorite lines from the show back and forth.</p>

<h2 id="the-mission">The Mission</h2>

<p>We deem the journey back to Paul&rsquo;s apartment in the Mission District too far to walk, and call an Uber to take us back.
Paul preps us with the facts on his tiny living space during the ride over.<br><br>
Once we arrive, we are pleasantly surprised. The place is just as small, if not smaller, as Paul had described. One bathroom, two bedrooms,
and a room with a fridge and square countertop that was to be known as &lsquo;the kitchen.&rsquo; The monthly rates are outrageous. We witness the process of
gentrification first hand, but collectively agree that there is nothing we can do. It is just the way it is now.<br><br>
We play one of Steve&rsquo;s older shows on Netflix. We hear many of the same jokes&ndash;we are glad that we heard them first live. Too tired to venture back out
into the city, we set up for the night and go to sleep.</p>

<h2 id="the-morning">The Morning</h2>

<p>We search for a cozy brunch spot in the mission. It is crazy how one moment, we are walking
in the midst of a historically significant neighborhood with largely much of its history
intact, but in the next we see skyscrapers and urbanization abound. The city has that jaggedness
to it. Brunch was excellent as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-departure">The Departure</h2>

<p>23 hours and 58 minutes later, we are back at the car, punching in our ticket to avoid
a large fine. We look back at the past 24 hours, at all the events that made up each memory.
Incredible.</p>
