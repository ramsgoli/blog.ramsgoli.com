				<p>So many articles out there preach &ldquo;proven methods to never give up.&rdquo; We live in such a fast-paced
society where execution and forward progress is worshipped. Quitting on a challenge, task, or idea can
make us feel weak, and is often frowned upon. It feels like we aren&rsquo;t strong enough to finish what we set out to accomplish,
or like we don&rsquo;t have the mental resolve to persevere. Giving up practicing the trumpet after
starting college always nagged at the back of my mind like a lonely child who tugs
at the bottom of his father&rsquo;s coat, innocently pleading for more attention. I had never been the best musician
in band all throughout high school, and packing away my brass tool always felt like an admission
to myself that I would never really be any good.<br />
<br />
We shouldn&rsquo;t forget the power of giving up. What if you gave up on something because you
knew all along that something more significant lay ahead of you? If you re-prioritized, you could
set yourself up for an even better opportunity. It&rsquo;s impossible to know what exactly you
are getting yourself into when you take your first steps. NGL, I&rsquo;ve thought about giving up on this blogging idea
once or twice. When that happens, I remind myself to pick my battles more carefully.
Where is the excess in my life that I can shave off? What other mental weights can I drop to
give myself more headspace? I&rsquo;m more informed now than I ever was. I trust myself to make the right
decision, but I also trust myself to know when I&rsquo;ve made the wrong one.<br />
<br />
There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with giving up when you have to. Sometimes you have to give up
in order to start again.</p>
