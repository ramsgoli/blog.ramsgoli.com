				<p>Solving your own problems is next to impossible when you have no idea where to begin.
This glaring issue strikes me so often at work, and even more so in my personal life.
I am faced with some challenging hurdle to jump over, but I have no context to
draw help from.<br />
<br />
I think the biggest blocker in these situations is my hesitancy to turn to someone
else for help. There was a time when I was taking CS131 and was stuck on the third or fourth
homework assignment for what felt like days. When talking to a friend about my dilemma, she
offered to help me come up with a working solution. I felt disappointed in myself that I was
handing in a homework assignment that I didn&rsquo;t fully understand. I would hole myself up alone in
the library while my friends all gathered together, sharing snacks and tips. I needed to do things
myself, my own way. I realized that I equated asking for help with an admission of weakness in myself. I felt very
vulnerable thinking about it that way.<br />
<br />
I had a conversation with my manager early in the summer on the topic of coming up with
solutions to one&rsquo;s problems that started to change my outlook on this feeling.
He shared with me some insight on the idea of <em>social bandwidth</em>.
There are plenty of great reasons to ask someone for help: people are good at explaining things in their domain of expertise.
However, their capability to do so is limited. This limit defines their social bandwidth, and once they have exhausted it,
each subsequent question they are asked receives a degraded response. People are not receptive
to loads of questions that are poorly thought out. This means that
meaningful questions, when asked with as much prior understanding as possible, result in high quality
answers. Do your due diligence in finding solutions on your own, and when you are faced with
the hurdle you can no longer jump over, ask.<br />
<br />
I&rsquo;m realizing now the power of asking the right amount
of the right questions. Thinking about the social bandwidth of those around me empowers me
to try and find answers to my own questions, and often I suceed even before needing to reach
out to someone else. I&rsquo;ve started to shift my perception of <em>asking</em> from one of admitting
weakness to one of persevering. <em>I&rsquo;ve done all I can to solve
this question, and I am too determined now to let the answer elude me any longer. There are
people out there who can help me through this.</em></p>

<p>Asking for help is still hard for me, but I&rsquo;m getting better. I know that I&rsquo;m surrounded
wherever I go by empathetic and loving individuals. I would not hesitate to help them if needed,
and I know they would do the same for me.</p>
