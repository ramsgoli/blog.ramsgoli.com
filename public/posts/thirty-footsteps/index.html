				<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the concept of <em>inputs</em> and <em>outputs</em>. Though, this shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise, right? I&rsquo;m a computer scientist.
My craft is solely concerned with transforming input to our information systems into consumable output for the outside world.</p>

<p>But by the end of my junior year at UCLA, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output">I/O</a> had become more than just the subject of that grueling chapter 23 in my computer architecture textbook.
The ability to correctly handle inputs and outputs determines the success of my own being just as much as any other information system.
I am just a singular computer chip plugged into a million lines of input.
Just take a second to think about this - the amount of data you and I consume on a daily basis is unfathomable. We
are perpetually plugged into our phones, television, and conversation with others.
It becomes easy to focus on just one line of input (like my phone) and block incoming traffic from others (like my mother&rsquo;s daily reminders to sleep before 1 am).</p>

<p>The voices and sights I experience everyday are inextricably linked to my own output - to the way I treat other
people, to the beliefs I espouse. As I came to realize this, I started to pay more and more attention
to the people that I spend my time with. And I&rsquo;ve been really lucky to have amazing friends and family sharing
their stories with me. If I want to provide the most value to the world as I truly can,
I have to surround myself with the best people along the way.</p>

<p>I often find myself overstepping my bounds in social situations, or not speaking up when I should have,
and regretting it afterwards. Parsing the input and determing the right output has never been easy, but it&rsquo;s a skill that
can be learned, just like any other. The more discomfort you expose yourself to, the more empathy you develop.
I&rsquo;m working on learning when to speak less and listen more, when to toss aside
what others are preaching and speak up for what I believe is right.</p>

<p>In order to keep refining this skill, I&rsquo;ve decided to spend thirty days focusing intently on
my inputs and outputs. I recently purchased a Medium membership(!) to allow myself to consume more, and have set an ambitious goal to write everyday for the
month of August. I borrowed this idea from my good friends <a href="https://medium.com/@dkb868">Dmitri Brereton</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@ABiasedHypocrite">Jorge Fuentes</a>,
because I strongly believe in their idea of &ldquo;writing for an audience of one.&rdquo;
I don&rsquo;t mind who reads these articles, or if people find them dull, offensive, or
just downright useless. I&rsquo;m writing them for <em>me</em>, so that I truly focus on <em>my</em> inputs and outputs, one
day at a time. These are my thirty one footsteps.</p>
